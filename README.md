# Elevation Grid
Controller program to create a grid of elevations based on a starting point. The frame of the elevations shifts every n seconds to reset.  Elevation is currently calcuated using a locally hosted version of the opentopodata API serving the ETOP01 data set: https://www.opentopodata.org/datasets/etopo1/.

The first version of this project will represent elevations on an LED matrix.
